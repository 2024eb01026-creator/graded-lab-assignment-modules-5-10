Command:
chmod +x patterns.sh

Explanation:
This command grants execute permission to the patterns.sh script. I observed that after running this command, the script became executable from the terminal.


Command:
./patterns.sh input.txt

Explanation:
This command runs the script using input.txt as input. I observed that the script processed the file and separated words into vowels.txt (only vowels), consonants.txt (only consonants), and mixed.txt (words containing both vowels and consonants starting with a consonant), ignoring case while checking patterns.
