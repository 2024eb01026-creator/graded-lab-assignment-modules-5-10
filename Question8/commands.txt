Command:
chmod +x bg_move.sh

Explanation:
This command provides execute permission to the bg_move.sh script. I observed that after running this command, the script became executable.


Command:
./bg_move.sh testdir

Explanation:
This command executes the script by passing testdir as an argument. I observed that each file inside testdir was moved into the backup/ subdirectory in the background, the PID of each move operation was displayed, and the script waited for all background processes to complete before finishing.
