Command:
gcc signal_handling.c -o signal_handling

Explanation:
This command compiles the C program using the GCC compiler and creates an executable file named signal_handling. I observed that no error messages were displayed, which indicates successful compilation.


Command:
./signal_handling

Explanation:
This command executes the compiled program. I observed that the parent process kept running, received SIGTERM after 5 seconds, then received SIGINT after 10 seconds and exited gracefully.
